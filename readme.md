# Neovim Configs

 - A dated version (and soon a commentary) also accessible via <https://buffer.rajpatil.dev/20231121164637-init_vim.html>

 - I'm primarily an Emacs user and use tmux + neovim at work
 - I write, take notes and code in lisp in Emacs
 - Both these usage philosophies inspire the other workflow for me and I don't take sides but I can defend both when the need arises.

I'm a one file man and prefer folding my code rather than having multiple files if they aren't necessary. Haven't delved into lua yet and might soon port all the vimscript into lua.
